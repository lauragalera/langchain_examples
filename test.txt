Jesus Christ, believed by Christians to be the Son of God and the Savior of humanity, was born in Bethlehem, Judea, around 4-6 B.C., during the reign of King Herod. His birth is described as miraculous, with his mother Mary being a virgin who conceived through the Holy Spirit. Jesus' early life was marked by the humble surroundings of a carpenter's home, raised by Mary and her husband, Joseph. Little is known about his childhood, though one event stands out: at the age of 12, he was found teaching in the Temple of Jerusalem, astounding the religious leaders with his wisdom.

At about 30 years of age, Jesus began his public ministry, following his baptism by John the Baptist in the Jordan River. This event marked the beginning of his mission to spread the message of God's Kingdom. He traveled throughout Galilee, Judea, and surrounding regions, performing miracles such as healing the sick, casting out demons, and even raising the dead. His teachings focused on love, forgiveness, humility, and repentance, often conveyed through parables, short stories with deeper moral or spiritual meanings.

One of the central themes of Jesus’ message was the coming of God's Kingdom, urging people to repent and believe in the gospel, or "good news." His teachings often challenged the religious establishment, criticizing hypocrisy and emphasizing a personal relationship with God over ritualistic observance of the law. His message of unconditional love extended not only to the Jewish people but to Gentiles (non-Jews), sinners, and outcasts.

Despite his popularity among many, Jesus’ growing influence angered religious leaders and Roman authorities, who feared he might incite rebellion. Around the age of 33, Jesus was betrayed by one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, and arrested. He was tried, condemned for blasphemy by the Jewish Sanhedrin and for claiming to be King of the Jews by the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate. Jesus was sentenced to death by crucifixion, a form of execution used for criminals and rebels. He was crucified at a place called Golgotha outside Jerusalem.

Three days after his death, Jesus' followers discovered that his tomb was empty. Christians believe that Jesus rose from the dead in what is known as the Resurrection, confirming his divine nature and victory over sin and death. Over the next 40 days, he appeared to his disciples, teaching them further about the Kingdom of God and preparing them to spread his message.

Before ascending to heaven, Jesus instructed his followers to go into the world and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them and teaching them to obey his commands. This event is known as the Ascension.

Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection are considered the foundation of Christian faith. Christians believe that through Jesus’ sacrificial death, humanity is offered forgiveness of sins and eternal life. His teachings continue to inspire millions around the world, with his message of love, redemption, and salvation being central to the Christian faith.
